Background
==========

Based on the Gibbs free energy calculated with quasi-harmonic approximation, this package serves the following purposes:

1. Plot phase diagrams for a given system
2. Plot energy difference at a given temperature and pressure range

Environment
===========

This package is build for **Python 3** with minimalism in mind. It depends only on

- **Numpy**: Math library.
- **Matplotlib**: Afterall, this is a package for ploting, right? :)
- **PyYAML**: Parses configuration file.

You would be able to install these dependencies with

.. code :: bash

  $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
